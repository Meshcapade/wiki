# SMPL-X

Based on a method called SMPLify-X, SMPL-eXpressive captures 3D hands, facial expression, and dody data from a single image. It comes with a model, SMPL-X that extends SMPL with fully articulated hands and an expressive face, a new pose prior built from large MoCap dataset, and a gender detector.
