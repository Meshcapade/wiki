### digidoppel

[digidoppel](https://digidoppel.com/) is our online platform which allows users to convert different kinds of inputs into realistic animation-ready 3D avatars. Users can use 3D scans or body measurements (more options for avatars from mocap, images & video coming soon!)


#### Measurements descriptions

Ankle circumference
key: ankle_circumference
The loop resulting from slicing a leg segment with a transverse plane at a fixed vertex for ankle.


Arm circumference at scye
key: arm_scye_circumference
The loop resulting from slicing an arm segment with a sagittal plane at a fixed vertex for armpit


Arm length (shoulder to elbow)
key: arm_shoulder_elbow
The line segment of a specified set of edges of the mesh


Arm length (shoulder to wrist)
key: arm_shoulder_wrist
The line segment  of a specified set of edges of the mesh


Arm length (spine to wrist)
key: arm_spine_wrist
The line segment  of a specified set of edges of the mesh


Chest circumference at maximum
key: chest_nipple_circumference
The loop resulting from slicing a torso mesh segment transversally at a fixed "nipple level" vertex.

Inseam
key: crotch_height
The height measured from the bottom of the mesh to a specified crotch vertex.

Crotch length
key: crotch_length
The line segment of a specified set of vertices (from top of navel, down along a sagittal segment to the opposing side)

Foot Length
key: foot_length
A line segment from the rearmost vertex on the foot to the foremost.

Height
key: height
The line segment to the lowest center point to the highest on the mesh.

Hip circumference
key: hip_circumference_max
Given a range of vertex locations (roughly representing the region at and below the navel and above the hip bone), slice the mesh transversally at each of those specified points, and pick the LARGEST slice for the hip measurement.

Hip Height
key: hip_height
The length from the bottom of the mesh up to the height of the hip circumference measurement.

Neck circumference at base
key: neck_base_circumference
The loop segment of a specified set of edges along the mesh.

Shoulder Breadth
key: shoulder_breadth
The length of the greatest extents within a defined "shoulder geometry" set of vertices from the sagittal axis.

Thigh Circumference
key: thigh_circumference
Given a range of fixed thigh vertices, transversally slice the mesh at these locations and use the greatest slice.

Waist Circumference
key: waist_circumference
Given a range of vertex locations (roughly representing the region at and below the navel and above the hip bone), slice the mesh transversally at each of those specified points, and pick the SMALLEST slice for the waist measurement.

Waist Height
key: waist_height
The length from the bottom of the mesh up to the height of the waist circumference measurement.
