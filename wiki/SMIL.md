# SMIL

SMIL stands for **Skinned Multi-Infant Linear Model**. Based on SMPL, the model is adapted for infant body shapes and poses. This realistic, data-driven body model allows accurate capture of shape and 3D body motion of freely moving infants.

Since the model is based on SMPL, it can be readily integrated into animation and fitting processes. New infant body space is computed from a large data of infant RGB-D scans from ~200K frames. SMIL faithfully represents poses and shapes of infants and captures enough information to allow medical assessments such as *General Movement Assessment* (GMA). 

Quantitatively, SMIL's metric accuracy is *~ 2.5 mm*.
