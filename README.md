# Meshcapade Wiki

Welcome to Meshcapade Wiki! 

Meshcapade is revolutionizing the world of human body modeling, sizing, and animation.
We employ state of the art statistical models that encode realistic body shapes, sizes, and motions. 

This wiki is dedicated to providing more in-depth knowledge about our parametric models, body and shape estimation technologies and our automated processing services.
